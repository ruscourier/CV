Iâ€™m fullstack systems engineer with extensive experience in various areas related to infrastructure, inclined to dive into new technologies, to use DevOps practices in his work. An ambitious specialist who is ready and able to solve any task with a search string. A 'Swiss knife'-man in the high-tech world, with a wide profile and a desire to learn something new.
